## **Simple Summary**
A proposal outlining the distribution for the Haptic network token.

## **Abstract**

The Haptic network token backs tokenized debt asset emission and the weekly monetary inflation is distributed as rewards to stakers in the system as a compensation for the staking inherent risks. The token has two primary functions:

* **Staking** - Users who stake HAP will receive inflationary rewards as a compensation for their role in the protocol. 
* **Governance** - Stakers receive Haptic debt shares (HDS) which determines their voting power.

## **Motivation**

The protocol revolves around HAP to back system debt and coordinate behavior on the platform. The monetary policy is designed to incentivise growth of the debt pool liquidity and reward parties involved. Inflation will run over the course of five years, starting 3 weeks after launch.  

## **Specification**

| Ticker      | Initial supply  | 
| :---        |    :----:   |    
| HAP         |100,000,000     |


## **Inflation**
Weekly emissions will start at 1,442,308 HAP the first week and reach 129,844 around the end of a five years period. 
The total supply at the end of the period will reach 245,312,500 HAP. 


| Period      | Increase | Total supply     |  Increase % |
| :---        |    :----:   |          ---: |          ---: |
| Year one      |75,000,000      |  175,000,000   |  75%  |
| Year two    | 37,500,000       |  212,500,000      | 21%   |
| Year three  |18,750,000        |  231,250,000      | 9%
| Year four   | 9,375,000        |  240,625,000      | 4%
| Year five   | 4,687,000        |  245,312,500      | 2%

| Entity      | Supply % |
| :---        |    :----:   |
| Haptic Treasury   | 30%       |
| Community growth   | 25%        |
| Core Contributors  |15%        |
| Synthetix Stakers      |10%      |
| Early stakers | 10%         |
| Early borrowers | 5%        |
| Investors   | 5%        |

## **Inflation and fees**
20% of inflation and protocol fees will be directed to the Treasury. 80% of inflation and fees will go to stakers. These percentages can be adjusted at the Technical Council's discretion via a HIP.

## **Escrow and vesting**
HAP obtained via inflation will be locked in Escrow for 1 year. Vesting HAP early will begin with a 80% burning fee, which will decay to 0 after 1 year.
